# Capsule

A CSS-only Hugo theme using the
[Bulma CSS framework](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma) and
[Font-Awesome icons](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome).

# Install

From the base of your website, run:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/sudorook/capsule themes/capsule
```

You can then either build Hugo on the command line and pass the `-t capsule`
flag, or you can add `theme = "capsule"` to your config.toml file.

**Note: Any additional documentation will be added to the
[Capsule Demo](https://sudorook.gitlab.io/capsule-demo) site, not here.**

## Notes:

### 1. Syntax highlighting (via pygments)

For code blocks, pick the highlighter style in config.toml by setting:

```toml
pygmentsstyle = "<style>"
```

For dark highlighter themes, you should rebuild capsule CSS with
`build/extra/syntax.sass`. Uncomment it from the capsule.sass file and run
`npm run build`.

Without that file, the background color will default to Bulma's light
background-color, and light colored elements meant to be displayed against dark
backgrounds from dark themes will be hard to read.

### 2. Unused classes in Bulma

Capsule is set to only compile the classes it needs. To enable more Bulma
classes, uncomment the relevant sass files in `build/bulma/bulma.sass`.

### 3. Enable automatic generation of nav menus

In your config.toml files, set:

```toml
SectionPagesMenu = "main"
```

With this set, capsule with automatically generate a navigation menu in the
navbar based on all the sections (the directories inside the content/ directory)
present in your site.

### 4. Add git metadata to your pages

If you host your site on a public git vc server, you can set capsule to build a
"Last edited on ..." note to each page that uses git metadata to display the
date of the last commit and add a link to its blob on your public repo.

In your config.toml file, set:

```toml
enableGitInfo = true

[params]
  repo = "https://github.com/<user>/<repo>

```

The `repo` variable should point to the url of your repo for your website. The
above example uses GitHub, but GitLab and any other site that follows the format
of `<siteurl>/<user>/<repo>/commit/<hash>` will work, too.

### 5. Add custom javascript or CSS to a page

In the toml header, add:

```toml
css = """
<style>
 ...
</style>
"""

js = """
<script>
 ...
</script>
"""
```

Any CSS or JS specified here will add to the site \<head\> when Hugo renders the
page.

### 6. Enable table of contents

To generate a table of contents for a specific page, add to the toml header:

```toml
toc = true
```

The table of contents will contain all the header items defined in the markdown.
The nesting levels for each match the header weight (h1, h2, etc.).

# Build

To (re)build the CSS, you need to have npm and installed. Clone the capsule
repository and once in it run:

```bash
npm install
```

and then build by:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can enable/disable sass components by editing build/sass/capsule.sass before
building. To use your own customized version of capsule, a) fork this repository
and set the Git submodule to use it, or b) make a symlink to your custom build
in the Hugo themes/ directory, assuming your build system allows this.
